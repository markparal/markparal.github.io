# My own personal website
---
For the longest time I've been meaning to sit down and build my own personal website. Previously, I've used a free Wix site to present some of my projects and experiences. Now, I use GitHub pages and Jekyll to host this site at my own domain, [markparal.com](https://markparal.com)! 

For more information you can check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/markparal/markparal.github.io). And, of course, don't forget to continue exploring the website!
