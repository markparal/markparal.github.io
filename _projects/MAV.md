# Meet the MAV
---
During the fall of 2020, I took the class AAE 251: Introduction to Aerospace Design. In this course, my team and I were tasked with coming up with a new concept for the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), specifically focusing on the propulsive aspects of the craft. The MAV is to be used in the upcoming Mars Sample Return Mission launching in 2026.

More information on the mission can be found [here](https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/20/nasa-narrows-design-for-rocket-to-launch-samples-off-of-mars/)

Our project evaluated multiple motor configurations using different propellant types. The final design used the ALITEC solid rocket propellant developed by Adranos Inc. It also used a two stage configuration powered by a Star 17A first stage and a Star 12GV second stage, which are both products of Northrop Grumman. The complete project report can be viewed below. This report secured my team the distinction as the winners of the Purdue AAE 251 Northrop Grumman Rocket Design Contest.
