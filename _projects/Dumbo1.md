# Meet Dumbo I

During the Summer of 2021, I decided to attempt my level 1 high powered rocketry certification. DUMBO I was the rocket I built for this challenge.

DUMBO I is a LOC Forte' kit. The rocket was 45.25" tall with a 3.1" diameter. Its weight was approximately 3.02 lb and it had a 38 mm motor mount. I flew DUMBO I with an I180-14A motor. Based on my OpenRocket simulation, DUMBO I reached an altitude of 3170 ft with a flight time of 122 s and maximum velocity of 703 ft/s. I recovered DUMBO I approximately 1 mile from the launch site, and it did not require any repairs.

After retrofitting DUMBO I to be a testbed for MITCH, I attempted to launch the rocket on December 12th. Unfortunately, the motor I used (I180) CATO'd on the launch pad setting the rocket on fire. Luckily, MITCH survived thanks to the payload bay being ejected by the motor explosion. Unfortunately, DUMBO I was not so lucky.
