# Senior Design Problem
---

For senior design, my team and I were posed with the task of creating a reference architecture for a manned mission to Mars. A list of major mission requirements was provided to define the intended outcomes of the mission. These requirements are stated as follows. 
1. The crewed mission needs to have humans on the Martian surface for seven years. 
2. For the duration of the mission, a crew of 4 needs to be on the surface of the planet. 
3. This mission needed to have astronauts on the surface of Mars at the earliest 2035 and at the latest 2040. 
4. The crew needs to return between 2040 and 2050. 
5. A minimum of five science objectives need to be pursued throughout the duration of the mission. 
6. Three novel technologies need to have been demonstrated through this mission. 
7. The mission is limited to a single pre-supply mission, and a maximum resupply payload of 5,000 kg to the surface of Mars.

Our proposed architecture took advantage of the Aldrin Cycler concept, a ballistic orbit which allows for a spacecraft to transfer between Earth and Mars without major propulsive maneuvers. More details on our architecture can be found in the final report below.
